// ============================================================
// Component-layer paired-token audit (Task 5's 5 new tokens: --{ns}-btn-fg /
// -danger-quiet-fg / -on-danger / -chip-bg / -chip-fg, plus the pre-existing
// bg/panel/btn-bg/btn-hover/danger roles they're required to pair against).
//
// CONVENIENCE LAYER, NOT THE COMPLETENESS AUTHORITY. Per spec
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-03-design-uplift-design.md §4.1: this
// registry-derived static gate is a supplement to, never a replacement for,
// the INDEPENDENT hand-written render oracle (tests/render-audit-checklist.mjs,
// Task 3 -- Codex BLOCK). That file's own header states the same rule from
// its side. A gap between what this static gate happens to check and what
// the oracle checks is a SIGNAL worth noticing, not a discrepancy to silently
// paper over by generating one from the other.
//
// "Programmatic enumeration from the composer's emitted token names" (the
// literal ask) means: this file never hardcodes what VALUE a themed block
// carries for any of these roles, and never hardcodes an assumption about
// which roles a given surface/block does or doesn't declare -- both are
// read fresh, every run, out of the actual shipped CSS text via tokenDict()/
// foldSelectorBlocks() below (the same source-of-truth the rest of this file
// already audits). A token's VALUE changing, or a role simply not being
// declared in some block, therefore needs zero edits here. What genuinely
// CANNOT be derived from names alone is the pairing RELATIONSHIP itself
// (nothing about the string "chip-fg" says it must clear AA against
// "btn-hover" too, for the pressable-chip case) -- COMPONENT_PAIR_SPEC below
// is a small, hand-declared registry of those relationships, mirroring
// COMPONENTS.md §1.3/§4.3/§5.3. A genuinely NEW relationship (not just a new
// value for an already-declared one) needs one line added here, same as
// COMPONENTS.md needs a new row for a new component.
//
// Icon/stroke non-text 3:1 (WCAG 1.4.11): `border` vs `btn-bg`/`panel` WAS
// deliberately left out of this registry by Task 7 -- measured (not guessed)
// against all 13 pilots at ratios ~1.0-1.73:1 (these borders were a
// deliberate subtle-divider design choice, not an AA-derived pair Task 5
// guaranteed), so gating on it then would have either redded the whole audit
// or needed 20+ fresh allowlist entries. design-uplift Task 16 (USER RULING)
// resolved the gap the other way Task 7 flagged as the alternative: a real
// borderToAA derivation (_ui-derive.mjs) now pushes every surface's border
// to clear 3:1 against both btn-bg and panel, so the two rows below are real
// COMPONENT_PAIR_SPEC coverage, not allowlist entries -- do not re-add an
// allowlist exemption for a `border` pair; if one fails, the derivation is
// what needs fixing, same rule the four `btn-bg vs btn-fg` exemptions above
// already established for fg/fill pairs. Icon color reuses --{ns}-btn-fg
// itself (COMPONENTS §2.2, currentColor inheritance) at a WEAKER 3:1
// requirement than the 4.5:1 text pairs already below, so it's structurally
// subsumed, not skipped.

// --pp-btn-bg / --pp-btn-hover until Soft Fill (design-uplift 2026-08-05)

// audit the strip the buttons sit on instead of the buttons, i.e. silently

//    as this file's existing metadata-fg check: "a MISSING token is itself
//    a failure").
//  - default-surface blocks (:root / html.dark): Task 5 deliberately added
//    ONLY the 5 new tokens there (visual-zero-change scope), leaving
//    whichever of bg/panel/btn-bg/btn-hover/danger/border the surface
//    already had (or didn't -- options' default surface once lacked

// Pilot overrides.css: hardcoded text colors that punch THROUGH the token gate.
//
// Everything above this point audits TOKENS. A pilot's `tokens.overrides.css`
// is appended verbatim after the composer's own output (compose-theme.mjs), at
// equal-or-higher specificity and later in source -- so a single hardcoded
// `color:` there silently wins over an AA-derived token and the token audit
// still reports green. That is not hypothetical: flexoki:dark's `.edit_links a`
// sat at 2.03:1 because an override pinned it to #575653 while the token it was
// supposed to read had been fine all along. Fixing the derivation without this
// scan would have moved the numbers in this file and nothing on screen.
//
// Rule: a hardcoded `color: #rrggbb` in an override is DEBT when it clears
// 4.5:1 against NEITHER the theme's `bg` NOR its `bg-surface` -- i.e. there is
// no base surface on the page where that text would be legible. Deliberately
// the conservative form of the question: "fails against one of the two" would
// red dozens of colors that are only ever painted on the base they pass on.
// `html.<mode-trigger>`-prefixed rules are measured against that mode's merged
// palette, not the base one.
//
// Excluded, by ROLE rather than by theme (so a new pilot inherits the same
// exclusions and none of the exemptions):
//   - non-text glyphs (.star / .selected_star) and ::before/::after decoration,
//     which are 1.4.11 shapes at most, not 1.4.3 text;
//   - submit/button labels, which sit on the control's own FILL (audited as
//     btn-bg vs btn-fg in auditPalette) rather than on bg/bg-surface.
//
// A rule that declares its own `background` used to be excluded for that same
// reason, and that exclusion had a hole: it assumed some OTHER row already
// covers the fill it names. True for the btn family, false for everything
// else. flexoki:dark's `a.help { color:#6B6963; background:#282726 }` and
// `a.sort_order_selected { background:#343331; color:#8B7EC8 }` are ordinary
// text on ordinary fills that no COMPONENT_PAIR_SPEC row mentions, and they
// were invisible to all 12 gates: the token audit measures `muted-soft`, which
// the override replaces, and this scan skipped the rule entirely. So a
// self-declared background is now MEASURED instead of waved through:
//   - a plain hex fill    -> exactly that pair, 4.5:1;
//   - `transparent`/`none`/`inherit`/... -> no fill of its own, so the rule
//     falls through to the page bases (bypass #2: `background: transparent`
//     used to delete the rule from this scan);
//   - `rgba()/rgb()`      -> composited over each page base, then measured;
//   - anything else (gradient / url() / var() fill) -> recorded as an
//     UNRESOLVED identity, which the baseline below then has to carry
//     explicitly. Never a silent skip: an unmeasurable pair is
//     indistinguishable from a passing one, which is how holes ship green.
// A `color: var(--pinboard-*)` is deliberately NOT scanned -- it reads the
// token layer this file already audits (auditPalette, including the on-<fill>
// rows that cover terminal's three `color: var(--pinboard-bg)` chips, whose
// accent fill is painted by the composer and not by the override), so
// measuring it here against the page bases would invent 1.00:1 false
// positives for text that never lands there. This scan is for hardcoded
// literals that punch THROUGH the token gate; a var() does not punch through.
//
// Gate shape: a RATCHET keyed on IDENTITY, not on a count. The inherited debt
// is printed in full every run, and the run FAILS on any entry that is not in
// contrast-debt-baseline.json -- so "delete one violation, add a different
// one" (Codex round-2, low 9, bypass #1: the count stayed at 40 and the gate
// stayed green) now reds the run. The listed lines stay visible instead of
// being spelled out as per-theme exemptions that read as settled decisions
// (the exact failure mode the ALLOWLIST comment above documents). Lowering
// the baseline is a per-theme design pass on the listed selectors -- most of
// them predate the token system and simply restate a muted tier that the
// composer now derives correctly on its own.
//
// 40 -> 41 on 2026-08-26: -1 (paper-ink's `.edit_links a { color:#aaa }` deleted,
// so that link finally reads the derived muted-soft tier) +2 (the two flexoki:dark
// own-background rules the exemption above used to hide). Net +1, and the two new

// ============================================================
// State delta: does :hover actually LOOK different from rest?
//
// The blind spot this closes, in one sentence: every gate above measures a
// foreground against a background, and nothing measured a color against the
// color it replaces. On 2026-08-26 the muted tiers were raised to AA and the
// `.edit_links a:hover` colors pinned in five pilot overrides were left where
// they were; on solarized-dark rest and hover became the SAME hex and the
// bookmark edit/delete links stopped reacting to the mouse entirely. All 12
// gates stayed green, because "rest vs hover" was not a question any of them
// asked.
//
// Three deliberate choices:
//
//  1. Measured in ΔE2000, not in WCAG contrast. Contrast ratio is a luminance
//     relation: it scores gruvbox's green->pink link hover at 1.02:1 — the same
//     as no change at all — so a ratio gate here would either miss every
//     hue-only hover or red every one of them. See deltaE2000 at the top.
//  2. Measured on the COMPOSED CSS (composeTheme + the pilot's overrides), not
//     on tokens. The regression lived entirely in override text that punches
//     through the token layer; a token-level version of this check would have
//     reported green right through it.
//  3. Pairs are ENUMERATED from the CSS, not hand-listed. Every rule whose
//     selector carries `:hover` and declares a `color` is paired with the same
//     selector minus `:hover`; a hand-written registry would only ever cover
//     selectors someone already thought to look at, which is how this class of
//     defect hides.
//
// Excluded: hover rules that also change background / opacity / text-decoration
// / border / shadow / weight. Those have a second feedback channel, so a small
// color step there is a style choice, not a dead state (#tag_cloud_header's
// 7px sort arrows go 0.7 -> 1.0 opacity, `a.bookmark_title:hover` underlines).
// The union of every rule matching a selector is what gets inspected, so an
// override that restates only the color cannot strip a channel the composer
// declared.
//
// Threshold: ΔE2000 >= 6. Measured, not picked — across all 14 rendered
// palettes the corpus splits into an empty band: every intentional hover step
// lands at 6.89 or higher, every flat-or-nearly-flat one at 4.27 or lower.
// (For scale, ~2.3 is the classic just-noticeable difference; 6 is "obviously
// a different color" without demanding a design change from themes whose hover

// ============================================================
// Identity ratchet for the two debt lists above (override text / dead hovers).
//
// WHY IDENTITIES AND NOT A COUNT. Both lists used to gate on `length <= MAX`.
// A count answers "how much debt is there", which is not the question the gate
// is asked: three separate edits slip past it (Codex round-2, low 9) --
// delete one violation and add a different one (count unchanged), and the two
// scanner bypasses that the effectiveDecl / NO_OWN_FILL work above closes.
// The set of (theme, selector, ...) identities answers the real question --
// "is every violation still one we already knew about" -- so the gate now
// FAILs on any entry the baseline does not name, whatever the total.
//
// THE BASELINE IS DEBT, NOT APPROVAL. Every id in contrast-debt-baseline.json
// is a real sub-AA color or a real dead hover that ships today. It is checked
// in so the ratchet has something to compare against and so the list is
// reviewable in a diff -- not because those lines are fine.
//
// HOW TO LOWER IT (the intended direction, no flag ceremony):
//   1. fix the theme (edit the pilot's overrides / palette),
//   2. `node docs/theme-surface/tools/contrast-audit.mjs`  -> prints the ids
//      that are now STALE (fixed, still listed),
//   3. `node docs/theme-surface/tools/contrast-audit.mjs --update-baseline`
//      -> prunes exactly those, refusing to add anything new,
//   4. commit the pilot change and the baseline together.
//
// HOW TO RAISE IT (deliberate, and it should be rare): only when a scanner
// change makes debt that was ALREADY SHIPPING newly visible -- the +2
// flexoki:dark own-background lines of 2026-08-26 are the canonical example.
// `--update-baseline --accept-new` is the only path that writes an addition,
// it prints every id it adds, and the diff is the review. It is NOT the way
// to land a new low-contrast color: that is a design change, and the answer
// there is to pick a color that clears 4.5:1.

// surface's own .preset-btn fill lives in --pp-preset-btn-bg/
// -preset-btn-hover-bg, DISTINCT token names from the themed layer's
// --pp-preset-bg (ROLE_ALIAS's pp "btn-hover" -> "drop-hover" is correct
// for the THEMED .preset-btn:hover, which really does use --pp-drop-hover,
// but the default surface's :hover uses --pp-preset-btn-hover-bg instead --
// aliasing "btn-hover" to either target globally would silently mis-check
// the other one). A bespoke pair, not a ROLE_ALIAS entry, so the themed
// layer's own (correct) resolution is untouched. BLOCKING: a FAIL here is
// a derivation bug, not a legitimate gap -- --pp-preset-fg/-preset-btn-bg/
// -preset-btn-hover-bg are all hand-written :root literals with no
