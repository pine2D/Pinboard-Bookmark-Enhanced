# Privacy Policy — Pinboard Bookmark Enhanced

**Last updated:** 2026-04-28

## Data Collection

Pinboard Bookmark Enhanced does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. The extension has no analytics, no tracking, and no telemetry.

## Data Storage

All data is stored **locally** on your device using Chrome's built-in storage APIs:

| Data | Storage | Synced via Google Account |
|------|---------|--------------------------|
| Settings & preferences | `chrome.storage.sync` | Yes |
| API keys (obfuscated) | `chrome.storage.sync` | Yes |
| Custom CSS & themes | `chrome.storage.sync` (chunked) | Yes |
| AI result cache | `chrome.storage.local` | No |
| Tag cache | `chrome.storage.local` | No |

## Network Requests

The extension only makes network requests to services **you explicitly configure**:

1. **Pinboard API** (`api.pinboard.in`) — to save, retrieve, and manage your bookmarks. Authenticated with your Pinboard API token.

2. **AI Provider APIs** (only when you click "AI tags" or "AI summary") — page title, URL, and the first 8 KB of extracted article text are sent to your chosen AI provider to generate tags or summaries. Supported providers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Cohere, SiliconFlow, Qwen, MiniMax, OpenRouter, Ollama, or a custom endpoint. **No data is sent to any AI provider unless you explicitly trigger it.**

3. **Pinboard website** (`pinboard.in`) — the content script injects custom CSS styles onto pinboard.in pages. No data is extracted or transmitted.

4. **Jina Reader** (`r.jina.ai`, optional) — when enabled by the user, page URL is sent to Jina to fetch a cleaner reader-mode rendering for AI processing. Disabled by default.

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | Read current page info (title, URL, selected text) for bookmarking |
| `storage` | Store settings and caches locally |
| `scripting` | Inject the Defuddle library into the active tab to extract clean article text, only when user triggers an AI feature |
| `tabs` | Access tab URLs for bookmark status detection and batch save |
| `notifications` | Show save confirmations for quick save / read later |
| `alarms` | Periodic cache cleanup and offline queue processing |
| `host_permissions` | API calls to Pinboard and the 13 configured AI providers |
| `optional_host_permissions: *://*/*` | Required by batch save to extract page text from arbitrary user-opened tabs; user grants per-session via Chrome's Just-in-Time prompt |

## Third-Party Services

The extension communicates with third-party services **only at your direction**:
- **Pinboard** — your bookmark service, using your API token
- **AI providers** — only the provider you select and configure with your own API key

No data is shared with any other third party.

## Changes

If this privacy policy changes, the update will be included in the extension release notes and the **Last updated** date above will be revised.
