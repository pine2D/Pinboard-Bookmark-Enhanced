// tests/render-audit-checklist.mjs — HAND-WRITTEN oracle. Never generate from
// composers/ui-components.mjs, composers/_ui-derive.mjs, the *-chrome.mjs
// token registries, or the pilots/*.tokens.json recipe sources.
//
// WHY hand-written and not generated: composers/ui-components.mjs (the
// recipe source) and the *-chrome.mjs token registries are exactly what this
// audit exists to check. A checklist mechanically derived FROM them would
// pass by construction -- a bug in the recipe would silently become "the new
// correct answer" instead of a failure. This was a Codex BLOCK verdict during
// the design-uplift SDD review (see docs/theme-surface/COMPONENTS.md's
// consumer table at the top of that file: this file is listed as the single
// source of truth for every geometry/contrast rule tagged `[render]`,
// independent of every generator in this repo). Every entry below was
// written by reading the shipped CSS (library.css / options.css / popup.css)
// and COMPONENTS.md by hand -- not derived, not scraped, not looped over a
// selector list pulled from a generator's output.
//
// Consumed by scripts/ui-render-audit.mjs. A CHECKS entry does NOT carry a
// `theme` field: the runner crosses every entry against every value in
// THEMES below, so "same selector, 15 theme states" is a runner-level concern
// (how do we reach a rendered instance), not an oracle-level one (what
// should be true once we're there). The known-failures key format
// (scripts/ui-render-audit.mjs) folds theme back in:
// "<surface>|<theme>|<selector>|<state>|<check>".
//
// expect keys (see docs/theme-surface/COMPONENTS.md for the exact rule
// behind each -- section references in comments below):
//   textContrast   -- computed `color` vs the actual composited ancestor
//                      background, WCAG ratio must be >= this floor (§1.3,
//                      §7.1 "成对消费律")
//   iconContrast   -- computed SVG stroke (inherits `color` via
//                      stroke="currentColor") vs actual background,
//                      ratio must be >= this floor (§2.2, WCAG 1.4.11)
//   iconVCenter    -- |svg boundingRect center Y - host button's content-box
//                      center Y| must be <= this many px (§2.3 `iconVCenter`)
//   backgroundAlphaMax -- computed background alpha must be <= this ceiling.
//                      Used when an icon-only affordance keeps a larger hit
//                      target but must not expose that target as a painted
//                      button shell in a low-emphasis state.
//   padGteRadiusH  -- computed padding-inline (px) >= min(border-radius px,
//                      height/2) -- pill law 2 (§5.1, §5.4 `padGteRadiusH`)
//   padVMin        -- computed padding-block (px) >= this many px --
//                      pill law 3, applies to every chip/badge (§5.1, §5.4)
//   heightEqWith   -- { selector, tolerancePx }: |this element's
//                      getBoundingClientRect().height - the comparison
//                      selector's height| <= tolerancePx. For same-row
//                      alignment (§6.3 `rowRungEq`) -- a single-selector
//                      `expect` key can't express "matches its neighbor",
//                      so this is the one two-selector shape in the
//                      vocabulary. The comparison selector is metadata on
//                      the check, not part of the known-failures key (the
//                      key's `check` segment stays the plain string
//                      "heightEqWith").
//   hitAreaMin     -- effective hit-area width AND height both >= this many
//                      px (§1.4 `hitAreaMin`). Includes the §1.5 ::before
//                      hit-area expansion when present (COMPONENTS.md §1.4
//                      always said "含 ::before 扩张" -- scripts/ui-render-
//                      audit.mjs's probeSelector reads
//                      getComputedStyle(el, "::before").width/height, which
//                      Chromium already resolves to the USED pixel size for
//                      an absolutely positioned, inset-constrained pseudo-
//                      element (verified live, never the literal "auto").
//                      Falls back to the host's own getBoundingClientRect()
//                      when there's no ::before or it isn't
//                      position:absolute. USER RULING: only icon-only
//                      buttons get this hard assertion -- do not add it to
//                      any icon+text button. design-uplift final-fix I2:
//                      no CHECKS entries carry this key any more -- the
//                      runner class-scans every icon-only <button> for it
//                      instead (scripts/ui-render-audit.mjs's sweepProbe
//                      family 4, gated the same as everything below through
//                      known-failures), so a new icon-only button is
//                      covered automatically instead of needing a hand-

//   widthLtParent  -- computed width (px) <= parent element's CONTENT-box
//                      width - 8px (NOT border-box: a stretched flex item
//                      fills exactly the parent's content box, which sits

//                      this check's first version. probeSelector computes
//                      it from the parent's getBoundingClientRect().width
//                      minus its computed padding and border). Regression
//                      guard for chip/badge elements that are flex ITEMS of
//                      a column-direction flex container: a flex item is
//                      always block-level regardless of its own inline-
//                      flex/inline-block display value (CSS Display §2.7),
//                      so the container's default `align-items: stretch`
//                      silently fills it to 100% width unless a real
//                      `width` declaration opts out -- a bug the chip
//                      family's generated recipe can't see (it never
//                      declares `width` either way, by design: pill/chip
//                      geometry is content-sized in every OTHER context
//                      this campaign uses it in). The 8px margin clears
//                      normal text-content width variance while still
//                      catching a full stretch (which reads as == parent
//                      content width, not "close to it").
//   textContrastMulti -- { ratio, extraBgSelectorVar }: computed `color` vs
//                      BOTH the actual composited background AND the
//                      current surface's `--{ns}-{extraBgSelectorVar}`
//                      token (e.g. "btn-hover"), each >= ratio. For
//                      `[aria-pressed]` chips, whose hover state repaints
//                      onto `--{ns}-btn-hover` instead of their resting
//                      chip-bg (§5.3/§5.4's `fgToAAMulti` pattern -- the
//                      chip's text color has to survive both paints, not
//                      just the one currently on screen). If the token
//                      can't be resolved to a color, the check degrades to
//                      the single actual-background comparison and the
//                      verdict's `note` says so explicitly -- it never
//                      silently drops the second background.
//   colorSchemeMatchesTheme -- true: computed `color-scheme` on <html> must
//                      include "dark" when the active THEMES entry is one of
//                      the 8 dark presets, "light" otherwise (Task 6). The
//                      one check in this file whose pass/fail literally
//                      depends on which THEMES value is active -- every
//                      other check's `expect` is a theme-independent
//                      literal; this one stays theme-independent IN THE
//                      CHECKLIST (`colorSchemeMatchesTheme: true`, no
//                      literal "light"/"dark") and scripts/ui-render-audit.mjs
//                      computes the expected value itself from the THEMES
//                      loop's current theme, same spirit as `heightEqWith`
//                      cross-referencing a second selector rather than a
//                      static number. Proxy for native-control (scrollbar,
//                      number spinner) rendering mode -- the thumb/track
//                      pixels themselves aren't probeable, but `color-scheme`
//                      is what actually drives them (COMPONENTS.md's "成对
//                      消费律" applied to a UA-rendered pair instead of an
//                      author-painted one).
//   textInset      -- { h, v }: for an element with a direct (own, not a
//                      descendant's) non-whitespace text node, the smaller
//                      of its two opposing insets (text bbox to the nearest
//                      element-or-ancestor's border padding-box edge) must
//                      be >= h horizontally, >= v vertically (§7.6). The
//                      border host is found by walking up from the element
//                      (self counts at depth 0) to the nearest ALL-FOUR-
//                      SIDES bordered box, stopping at any scrollable or
//                      single-line-ellipsis boundary in between -- see
//                      scripts/ui-render-audit.mjs's findBorderBoxHost for
//                      the full walk. Task 14: options preset-preview's
//                      `<summary>` text sat flush against its enclosing
//                      `#preset-preview-section`'s border because an id
//                      selector zeroed the summary's own horizontal padding.
//   childContainment -- true: a `<summary>`'s icon/pseudo-element children
//                      (svg, ::before, ::after) must stay inside the
//                      summary's own border-box, +/-1px tolerance (§7.6).
//                      Scoped to `<summary>` only -- ordinary buttons'
//                      `::before` hit-area expansion (§1.5) is SUPPOSED to
//                      paint outside the host's visual box, so this check
//                      would misfire on every one of them if it weren't
//                      disclosure-specific. Task 14: the same zeroed-padding
//                      bug left no room for the ::after chevron's rotated
//                      7x7 bbox, which painted ~1.45px past the border.
//   beforeExists   -- true: the host's ::before pseudo-element actually
//                      renders (non-zero size), not just that `content` is
//                      declared. Reuses --sweep's own measurePseudo helper
//                      (containmentChildren) -- pseudo-elements aren't
//                      document.querySelector-able, so this is the only
//                      layer that can see one at all. design-uplift preset-
//                      row redesign (2026-08-04): the swatch dot that
//                      replaced the old bordered-pill chrome.
//   insetBand      -- { minInsetPx, blockInsetPx, radiusVar }: the element
//                      that PAINTS a list's hover/selected band must be held
//                      at least minInsetPx clear of its container on both
//                      inline sides, blockInsetPx on both block sides, and
//                      carry exactly the radius rung named by radiusVar
//                      (e.g. "radius-md") on THAT theme -- a rung, not a px
//                      floor, because a theme's ladder is authoritative
//                      (gruvbox-dark's md is 2px and that is correct)
//                      (COMPONENTS.md §9 law 3, Soft Fill). One verdict for
//                      both halves on purpose: a rounded band at full bleed
//                      still cuts the container's corners, and an inset
//                      square band still reads as a stripe -- neither half
//                      is a design rule on its own. `actual` reports the
//                      smaller of the two insets; a zero radius fails with
//                      an explicit note instead of passing on the inset
//                      alone. blockInsetPx and minRadiusPx were added
//                      2026-08-05 after the first version passed on an
//                      implementation the user rejected on sight: 4px inline
//                      / 0px block plus a 2px radius satisfied "inset AND
//                      rounded" to the letter while reading as a misaligned
//                      stripe. The gap was in the oracle, not in the run.
//                      radiusVar (not a px number) came out of the same
//                      round: the first repair used minRadiusPx: 4 and
//                      immediately red-flagged gruvbox-dark, whose whole
//                      ladder is 2px by design.
//                      Written against the band-painting element,
//                      which is NOT always the row: library's vocabulary
//                      rows paint --row-bg on .notes-card-top inside
//                      .vocab-card, so the entry names the child.
//   tabChrome      -- { activeUnderline, underlinePx }: a tab is a label plus
//                      a selection edge (§9 law 7). BOTH branches assert "no
//                      shell" (no fill, no radius) -- that is the half that
//                      regressed. activeUnderline:true additionally requires
//                      an opaque bottom border of >= underlinePx (default 2);
//                      false requires none. Two entries, two selectors, one
//                      key -- the runner cannot ask "is this the selected
//                      one", the checklist says which is which.
//   outlineContrast -- N: computed outline-color vs the REAL composited
//                      background the ring paints OVER (bgStack minus the
//                      host's own layer, since outline-offset pushes the
//                      ring outside the host's border box onto its
//                      parent's paint), WCAG 1.4.11 non-text floor (§3.3
//                      `focusRingContrast`, generalized from focus-only to
//                      any rendered ring). design-uplift preset-row
//                      redesign: the 2px accent selection ring that
//                      replaced the old border-drawn check tick.
//
// weakTextOnFill (family 13, weak-text-on-fill batch T5, COMPONENTS.md
// §9.1 law 8): no CHECKS entries carry this key -- like hitAreaMin (family
// 4) and families 5-12, the runner class-scans instead of taking a hand-
// enumerated selector list, so a new consumer is covered automatically
// rather than needing a row added here. Unlike families 4-12 (theme-
// invariant geometry, one sweep pass), this one IS per-theme: colour tokens
// vary by theme, so scripts/ui-render-audit.mjs's weakTextProbe runs once
// per (surface, theme) from inside the CHECKS loop's already-open page
// (recordWeakTextHits' call sites in runSimpleTheme/runLibraryTheme) rather
// than a second whole-matrix navigation pass.
//   SCOPE: every element with a direct (own, non-descendant) text node, plus
//     every icon-only button/`.btn`/`a.btn` (an SVG icon has no colour of
//     its own -- it inherits `color` via `stroke="currentColor"`, so the
//     host's computed `color` is what a text check would read anyway).
//     computed `color` is compared against the ACTIVE theme's live
//     `--{ns}-fg-hint` / `--{ns}-fg-muted` / `--{ns}-link` values (never a
//     CSS-source literal); if it matches one of those TEXT roles, the
//     nearest non-transparent `background-color` walking from the element
//     itself up through its ancestors (some consumers, e.g. `.md-strip-btn`,
//     paint their own background; others, e.g. `.connection-health-state`,
//     inherit it from a parent) is compared against the same theme's live
//     `--{ns}-btn-bg` / `--{ns}-btn-hover` / `--{ns}-input-bg` /
//     `--{ns}-chip-bg` -- and, library only, its two batch-selection accent
//     bands (D6 follow-up / Ruling 17), computed from the live
//     `--lib-bg`/`--lib-accent` tokens and the composer's OWN exported
//     `LIB_BATCH_BAND_MIX` percentages (never a hand-typed 0.20/0.26). A
//     match on both sides is a FAIL.
//   REST STATE ONLY -- hover is explicitly OUT of scope. This family covers
//     the cascade shape a static same-selector scan (tests/ui-contract-
//     tests.mjs) structurally cannot see (colour on one rule, the fill on an
//     ancestor rule), not every state a control can be in; hover's token-
//     side coverage is contrast-audit's `btn-fg-muted vs btn-hover` / `fg vs
//     btn-hover` rows, which gate the ROLE regardless of which selector
//     paints it.
//   COVERAGE (T5 fix wave, F5a/F5b): this family runs its OWN activation
//     loop, not just whatever CHECKS groups happen to open for other
//     reasons. options: all 13 tab panels (every `.panel`, `.panel{display:
//     none}` in options.css means 12 of them are otherwise never scanned),
//     every non-help `<details>` inside the active panel, the appearance
//     tab's preset-preview section, its theme-name popover
//     (`#save-custom-theme` -> `.theme-name-popover`) and a confirm popover
//     (`.saved-theme-del` -> `.confirm-popover`), and the Account tab's
//     Connection Status disclosure. popup: the rest state, the 11 hidden-
//     by-default legs scripts/ui-render-audit.mjs's runSweep already knows
//     how to reveal (existing-banner/url-warning/url-clean-hint/presets-row/
//     suggest-row/ai-error-card/ai-error-fallback/batch-permission/batch-
//     progress/md-actions-strip/offline-queue-list, plus the offline-queue
//     rows themselves), and the confirm popover. library: vocab rest state,
//     the vocab batch-selected band, the notes batch-selected band (each
//     opener is fail-CLOSED -- a missing target throws SETUP rather than
//     silently scanning the wrong state). Every panel/leg opener throws
//     `SETUP: ...` on a missing target instead of silently skipping (a
//     shape a future selector rename could otherwise turn into a silent
//     "0 FAIL"), and scripts/ui-render-audit.mjs prints scanned counts per
//     (surface, theme, context) so "0 FAIL" can be told apart from "never
//     opened".
//   EXEMPTIONS -- every class is a TRIGGER, not an automatic drop: a hit is
//     only exempted once the REAL painted ratio between the scanned colour
//     and the resolved fill (reusing contrast-audit.mjs's own `cr`) clears
//     4.5:1 for text or 3:1 for an icon-only affordance (the same floor
//     COMPONENTS.md §9.1 uses for icons). A trigger that fails its ratio is
//     still reported, annotated `[was-exempt-by ...]` so the near-miss is
//     visible rather than looking like a plain scan miss.
//     - `:disabled` (WCAG 1.4.3) -- the ONLY unconditional exemption, no
//       ratio gate: checked via the live `disabled` IDL property walked up
//       the ancestor chain, never by matching ":disabled" in a selector
//       string, so a scratch selector like `.x:not(:disabled)` or
//       `.x:disabled ~ .y` can't be mistaken for the real exemption (tests/
//       ui-contract-tests.mjs tightened the analogous static-scan exemption
//       to the same rule, Ruling 16).
//     - identity -- the scanned colour ALSO equals one of the tokens
//       COMPONENTS.md §9.1 law 8 itself sanctions as text-on-fill: `fg`,
//       `btn-fg`, `btn-fg-muted`, and (library only) `--lib-row-selected-fg`.
//       Every matching role name is recorded (not first-match-wins) so a
//       collapse across more than one sanctioned token is labelled
//       correctly.
//     - selection-marker -- the scanned colour equals `accent` AND the
//       element carries a selection-state marker (`aria-pressed="true"`,
//       `aria-selected="true"`, `aria-current`, `.active`, `.selected`):
//       accent painted on a pressed/selected control, not hint/muted/link
//       misuse (library's pressed sort-seg cell is the reviewed, accepted
//       instance of this shape).
//     - safe-host -- the resolved fill is EXACTLY (no tolerance) one of the
//       page-level surfaces fg-hint/fg-muted are independently guaranteed
//       AA against on every themed block (contrast-audit.mjs's
//       auditCssThemes/auditLibraryThemes): `bg`, `bg2`/`panel`, and, on
//       options only, `pf-bg`/`code-bg` (D5) and, on popup only,
//       `drop-hover` (options never declares `--opt-drop-hover`, so that
//       role is not in its safe-host list at all). `link` is EXCLUDED from
//       this exemption on popup/options -- neither surface has a "link vs
//       <host>" row in contrast-audit.mjs, so there is no guarantee to fall
//       back on; library keeps `link` eligible because its "link vs bg"/
//       "link vs panel" rows genuinely cover it.
//   OUT OF SCOPE (T5 fix wave, F5c -- not silently missed, deliberately not
//     modelled): background-image/gradient fills; `::before`/`::after`
//     fills; `::placeholder` text; alpha compositing (`parseColor` discards
//     alpha -- a semi-transparent fill or text colour is not resolved
//     against its true composited result); icon-only `<a>`/`<summary>`
//     (the icon-only scan is scoped to `button, [role='button'], .btn,
//     a.btn`) and icons inside a button that ALSO carries its own label
//     text (the icon's colour is not independently probed there); any
//     `color-mix()` fill other than library's two batch-selection bands.
//   Options' target role set is fg-hint/fg-muted/link only -- COMPONENTS.md
//     §9.1 law 8 does not name a fourth "fg-dim" role, and `--opt-fg-dim`
//     was itself retired before this batch (taste-uplift batch2 Task 5); the

  // plain http(s) page, not merely a slow one: empirically confirmed by
  // waiting 2s past the automatic call with no manual refresh -- the bar
  // never appeared. Fixed by moving the call before the early return, next

  // the SAME height a different way -- it's stretched to match its select
  // siblings by its row's align-items:stretch, not by its own padding/
  // line-height, so it's the one selector that actually exercises that

  // `removeClass`/`clearDisabled` (independent review F2/F3, 2026-08-08):

  // + `disabled = false` first. Skipping that meant the "rest" baseline this
  // check reads could be measuring whatever OTHER state the element had been
  // left in by an earlier check, not the idle resting cascade the fix
  // actually has to out-rank -- and with no settle wait, a read taken in the
  // same task as classList.add() could land mid-transition on `.btn`'s own
  // `transition: background ...` instead of at the target value. Both fixed:
